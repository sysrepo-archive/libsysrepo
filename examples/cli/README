The cli program is a command line interface to a sysrepo daemon.  The 
May 2015 version of cli uses sysrepod srd protocol and the sysrepod
sockets API.  The cli program uses GNU readline and has been derived
from the fileman.c program for using readline for file operations.
The cli program instead has sysrepod RPC operations.

INSTALLATION

The Makefile shows the several dependencies:

1) https://github.com/sysrepo/sysrepod
2) The GNU readline package
3) The libxml2 package

BUILD

Type "make" to produce a sysrepod executable.

RUN

Type "./sysrepo" to start sysrepo.  The commands are described by typing
"help" or "?" on the command line.  The typical sequence of operations
would be as follows:
sysrepo> connect
sysrepo> open sshd_config
sysrepo> ...

Once a connection is made to a sysrepo server and a repository has been
opened, operations against the server and the datastore can proceed.
An example would be:
sysrepo>xslt sshd_config.xsl

Or:
sysrepo> send <xml><command>disconnect</command></etc>

The last "send" command example exposes a bug in the current software:
Since the send string is opaque to cli, the cil send routine does not
properly update the connection state machine to disconnected.
