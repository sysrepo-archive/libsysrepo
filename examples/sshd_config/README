SSHD_CONFIG is the configuration file used by the SSH daemon.
This directory contains the following files.

1. sshd_config.yang is the YANG data model for an sshd_config
   file.
2. sshd_config.xsl is the XSLT stylesheet for extracting an
   sshd_config file from an XML document or a sysrepo repository.
3. The Makefile makes .xml, .dsdl, .rng, .xsl files from 
   sshd_config.yang.

The tools used in this directory can make an XML document file
from sshd-config.yang and derived files.  sshd-config.xml is
an XML instantiation of sshd_config.yang containing the default
values from the yang file.  Other intermediate relaxng schema
files and stylesheets are also created by the make process.
These are described below.

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Makefile shows the dependencies:

1) https://github.com/mbj4668/pyang.git
2) The xstlproc package
3) The jing package and Java runtime

Note that #3, jing, can be replaced by xmllint, which has equivalent
functionality but inferior error reporting.

BUILD
~~~~~

It is necessary to set two environment variables.

export PYANG_XSLT_DIR='/usr/local/share/yang/xslt/'
export PYANG_RNG_LIBDIR='/usr/local/share/yang/schema/'

The path to the XSLT_DIR and PYANG_RNG_LIBDIR may vary depending on your
pyang installation.

Type "make" to produce the dsdl and xsl files.

Type "make xml" to produce the XML instance document sshd-config.xml.  

"make sshd_config" produces an sshd configuration file.

USE
~~~

The "make sshd_config" rule can be run from the command
line as:

xsltproc sshd-config.xsl sshd-config.xml

This operation can similarly be performed through sysrepod, which is the
object of sshd_config tools and files.  But to run this to sysrepod, the
cli tools can be used from libsysrepo/examples/cli - provided of course
that sysrepod is installed and running.  And provided that sysrepod has
the sshd_config schema information that it needs to answer queries such
as from the cli tool.

Thus, the main use of sshd_config is to produce the files needed to
derive a sysrepod schema from a YANG file and to apply sshd-config.xsl
to a sysrepod repository that has sshd_config schema.  These schema
can be validated.

"make validate" will validate the schema produced by "make" against the
sshd-config.xml file, which is a by-product of the make process but
that can be explicitly created by "make xml."

The schema-related files produced by the Makefile are the following.

1. sshd-config.dsdl
   This is the RFC 6110 hybrid schema file.

2. sshd-config.rng
   This is the RelaxNG schema file.

3. sshd-gdefs-config.rng
   This file contains global definitions that are part of the RELAX NG 
   schema. For certain technical reasons they have to be in a separate 
   file.

4. sshd-config-dsrl.xsl
   XSLT stylesheet that add default values of leafs where 
   sshd-config.xml doesnâ€™t provide an explicit value.

5. sshd-config-sch.xsl
   This XSLT stylesheet checks all semantic rules as defined in the 
   YANG model.
